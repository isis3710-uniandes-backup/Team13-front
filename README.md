# Description

4Berry is an amazing website where you can do Storyboards online !! You start with just your email and a password. Then, there's a world of possibilities. Stories are up to your imagination. You can draw and write the text of every scene of a storyboard. If you are tired and you want to work on it later, you can save it on your profile. We are still on the development of 4Berry but the main idea is to bring stories alive and join a community of storyboarders !!
